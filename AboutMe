I’m a U.S. Navy veteran who served as a Gunner’s Mate, where I gained hands-on experience in high-pressure environments that demanded precision, discipline, and strategic thinking. After completing my service, I transitioned into the world of data and analytics, driven by a passion for problem-solving and uncovering insights through data. I currently work as a Data Analyst at Spectrum, where I support business decisions by analyzing complex datasets and visualizing trends that drive operational improvements. I'm also completing my Bachelor’s degree in Data Analytics at Queens University of Charlotte and will graduate in May 2025. With a strong foundation in both technical skills and real-world experience,I’m passionate about using data to solve challenges and create impactful change.
