This project was created with my team
The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using basic machine learning techniques. We take a look at info like age, gender, ticket fare, and passenger class to figure out who's more likely to survive.

we will be working with three files: train.csv (the main dataset with survival info), test.csv (where we make our predictions), and gender_submission.csv (a sample submission to guide your format).

How it works: First, we try to clean the data—filling in missing values, converting text to numbers. Then we train a Random Forest model, and evaluate them using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Once we’re happy with the model, we use it to predict on the test data for submission.
